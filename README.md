You need Python version 3.

There are three ways to run the program.

Running the program with no arguments will create a random pattern to run the algorithm on with 25 generations
```python
python3 main.py
```

The first argument passed will be the number of generations to run
```python
python3 main.py [GENERATION_COUNT]
```

The second argument passed is a path to a file that contains a pattern to run the algorithm on
```python
python3 main.py [GENERATION_COUNT] [PATH_TO_PATTERN_FILE]
```
